# Random Fish

Generates different random objects according to different strategies.

## For Consumers

### Installation
Prepare a virtual environment if missed:
```bash
python3.13 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```
Install the package:
```bash
pip install --extra-index-url=https://test.pypi.org/simple/ random-fish
```

## For Developers

### Cloning the project

Run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ABKorotky/random-fish.git
cd random-fish
```

### Preparing a virtual environment

Run the following commands:
```bash
python3.13 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Tox functionality
The package provides the following ['tox' tooling](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/):
- `cs`. Code Style. Checks project's code style using `black` and `flake8` tools.
- `ann`. Annotation. Checks types annotations in the project using `mypy` tool.
- `utc`. Unit Tests with Coverage. Runs project's unit tests and calculates a level of coverage.
- `format`. Formatting. Reformats code in the project using `black` and `isort` tools.
- `doc`. Documentation. Generates project's documentation using `sphinx` tool.
- `build`. Builds an archive for distributing the project via PyPI.
- `upload`. Uploads a prepared distribution archive into one of PyPI (main or test). Uses Test PyPI by default.

Run `tox l` command for details.

### Development rules and agreements
Follow Python's principles [PEP 20 – The Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/):
- Simple is better than complex.
- Explicit is better than implicit. And so on...

Follow ["SOLID"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles:
- Single responsibility principle.
- Open–closed principle.
- Liskov substitution principle.
- Interface segregation principle.
- Dependency inversion principle.

### Branching model
Based on "GitHub-Flow". Extends by release branches on demand. Rules:
- `main` branch is default stable branch. It uses for releasing new stable distributions.
- Use different `<feature>` branches for developing. Count of commits in feature branches and them messages are not limited.
- Code in "feature" branches should be prepared and tested properly before merging. Running `tox` should pass successfully.
- Merging branches is enabled in the same branch from it was born. Squash commits before merging. Make rebasing on target branch, merge with `--ff-only` strategy.
- Merging code in `main` branch is an intention to release it. So, almost all commits in `main` branch should be tagged.
- Follow [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) principles for tagging commits.
- Tags in `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` in `main` branch are placeholders for creating corresponded release branches.
- Use release branches for maintaining several versions at the same time. Format of release branches is `release/<major>.<minor>`.
- Tags on `main` branch should increase monotonic. It's forbidden to create tags in sequence like: `0.2.0` -> `0.2.1` -> `0.3.0` -> `0.3.1` -> `0.2.2`. Start a release branch `release/0.2` from tag `0.2.1` and implement required logic. Mark the commit in the release branch as `0.2.2` and release it.
- Use `cherry-pick` mechanisms for transferring changes between `main` branch and supported release branches. So, make `cherry-pick` of `0.2.2` commit from `release/0.2` branch into `main` and deliver it as `0.3.2` for instance.

Recap: Every time commits structure in the project should look as a tree.

### Releasing new distributions flow
1. Create a `feature` branch from `main` or release one.
2. Make corresponding changes. Don't be afraid to run `tox -e format` and `tox` sometimes during development.
3. Run `tox -e doc`.
4. Examine generated documentation.
5. Squash all commits into one and rebase your changes on the actual state of the target branch.
6. Write what you have done in `CHANGELOG.md` file into the corresponding section. Don't forget to actualize the `VERSION` of these changes in `random_fish/__init__.py` file.
7. Examine diff before merging, clean it from accidentally committed garbage.
8. Run `tox -e format` on ready for merging commit.
9. Run `tox` of ready for merging commit. Ensure that the command passed successfully.
10. Merge your `feature` branch into target one: `main` or one of `release`.
11. Mark the commit by tag according to the version from `CHANGELOG.md` file.
12. Prepare a distribution from the tag. Run `tox -e build`. Make final checks with generated archive. Ensure it is installed properly.
13. Publish the archive in Test PyPI. Run `tox -e upload -- dist/random-fish-<version>.tar.gz`. Ensure that the distribution is installed properly from Test PyPI. Prepare a temporary environment and run `pip install --extra-index-url=https://test.pypi.org/simple/ random-fish`.
14. Publish the archive in main PyPI. Run `export PYPI_REPOSITORY_ALIAS=pypi` for switching uploading to main PyPI and repeat uploading via `tox -e upload -- ...`. Ensure that the distribution is installed properly from PyPI. Prepare a temporary environment and run `pip install random-fish`.

Use this flow for releasing distributions from release branches.
